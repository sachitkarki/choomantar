Choomantar is an open source  data security software which hides the data into some other file called as carrier file. The hiding of data in carrier files depends on a key which is taken from the user. The software was completely based on Kerckhoffs’ principle – That the algorithm can be public till the key is private.

The project is based on the concept that data can be made secure if the presence of data was not known to anyone. This is achieved by hiding data inside another file called as carrier files. As image files are transferred a lot over the internet image carriers are best to hide other files in them. The project supported a lot of carrier files like image file formats like BMP,JPG.

Also other carriers files for e.g. text files can also supported by the software.
